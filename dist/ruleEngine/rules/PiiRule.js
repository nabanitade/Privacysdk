 * PiiRule - Basic Email Address Detection
 *
 * This rule provides basic detection of email addresses in code. It serves as a
 * foundational rule for identifying personally identifiable information (PII)
 * in the form of email addresses that may be hardcoded or improperly exposed.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Email address pattern recognition
 * - Hardcoded email detection
 * - Email exposure in code validation
 * - Basic PII protection enforcement
 * - Simple and reliable detection
 *
 * Detection Capabilities:
 * - Standard email address formats
 * - Hardcoded email strings
 * - Email addresses in variable assignments
 * - Email addresses in configuration files
 * - Email addresses in comments or documentation
 *
 * Privacy Laws Addressed:
 * - GDPR Article 4: Definitions (personal data)
 * - CCPA Section 1798.140: Definitions
 * - Basic privacy protection requirements
 *
 * Pattern Recognition:
 * - Standard email regex pattern matching
 * - Context-aware email detection
 * - Suppression support for legitimate use cases
 *
 * Usage:
 * This rule serves as a basic building block for PII detection,
 * focusing specifically on email addresses. It provides simple
 * and reliable detection of email-related privacy violations.
