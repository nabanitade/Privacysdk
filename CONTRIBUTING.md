## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)
- **TypeScript** knowledge (for development)
- **Git** for version control

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the PrivacySDK repository
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/privacysdk.git
   cd privacysdk
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://gitlab.com/tnabanitade/privacysdk.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Environment Configuration

For AI-enhanced scanning, set up environment variables:

```bash
# Google Cloud Configuration (for Vertex AI)
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true

# Gemini Configuration
export GEMINI_ENABLED=true
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-google-ai-api-key"
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-3-pro-preview"
export GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS=4000
export GEMINI_TEMPERATURE=0.1

# Hardcoded Rules Configuration
export HARDCODED_RULES_ENABLED=true
```

## Contribution Process

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [Code Standards](#code-standards) below
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new privacy rule for data retention"
git commit -m "fix: resolve timeout issue in AI scanning"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new configuration options"
```

### 4. Push and Create Merge Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a merge request on GitLab with:
- Clear description of changes
- Link to related issues
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Test results

## Code Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### File Structure

```
src/
├── ruleEngine/          # Privacy rule implementations
│   ├── rules/          # Individual rule files
│   └── RuleEngine.ts   # Main rule orchestrator
├── scanners/           # Language-specific scanners
├── index.ts           # Main entry point
└── types/             # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for utilities
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `JavaScriptScanner`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `scanFiles`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `IGNORED_PATHS`)
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase with 'I' prefix (e.g., `IScanner`)

### Documentation Standards

- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all public APIs
- Include examples in documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Document new environment variables

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `__tests__/` directories
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for >80% code coverage

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('JavaScriptScanner', () => {
  describe('scanFiles', () => {
    it('should find JavaScript files in directory', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should skip ignored paths', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```
