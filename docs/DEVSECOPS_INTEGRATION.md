## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. **GitLab Project Variables**

Configure these variables in your GitLab project (Settings → CI/CD → Variables):

```bash
# Required Variables
GITLAB_TOKEN=your-gitlab-access-token
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-google-ai-api-key

# Optional Variables
GEMINI_ENABLED=true
HARDCODED_RULES_ENABLED=true
PRIVACY_SCAN_TIMEOUT=300
FAIL_ON_HIGH_SEVERITY=true
MAX_VIOLATIONS_THRESHOLD=50
```

### 2. **GitLab Access Token Setup**

1. Go to GitLab → User Settings → Access Tokens
2. Create a new token with these scopes:
   - `api` (Full API access)
   - `read_user` (Read user information)
   - `read_repository` (Read repository)
3. Copy the token and add it as `GITLAB_TOKEN` in your project variables

### 3. **Google Gemini API Key**

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com)
2. Create an API key for Gemini
3. Add it as `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your project variables

- **AI-enhanced analysis** with Gemini (optional)
- **Merge request feedback** with detailed reports
- **Quality gates** that enforce compliance thresholds

### **Security Scan Stage**
- Additional security checks
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security audit reports

### **Build Stage**
- Creates production artifacts
- Optimizes for deployment

### **Deploy Stage**
- Staging deployment (automatic)
- Production deployment (manual approval)

### **Compliance Report Stage**
- Generates comprehensive compliance reports
- Creates dashboard data
- Sends notifications

---

## 💬 Merge Request Integration

### **Automatic Feedback**

Every merge request automatically receives:

```markdown
## 🔒 Privacy Compliance Check Results

### 📊 Scan Summary
- **Total Violations**: 3
- **High Severity**: 1
- **Medium Severity**: 2
- **Low Severity**: 0

### 📋 Detailed Findings
```
1. src/config/database.ts:15
   Hard-coded or Plain-text PII / Secrets: API key exposed
   Suggested Fix: Move to environment variables
   Severity: HIGH
```

### 🚀 Recommendations
- Review all privacy violations before merging
- Address high-severity issues immediately
- Consider implementing suggested fixes
- Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance
```

### **Quality Gates**

The pipeline will **block merging** if:
- High-severity violations are detected
- Total violations exceed the threshold
- Privacy compliance checks fail

---

## 📊 Compliance Dashboard

### **Real-time Monitoring**

The integration provides:

- **Violation Trends** over time
- **Compliance Status** by project/team
- **Severity Distribution** charts
- **GDPR/CCPA Compliance** tracking
- **AI vs Hardcoded Rules** comparison

### **Automated Reports**

Generated reports include:
- `compliance-report.txt` - Detailed findings
- `compliance-dashboard.json` - Dashboard data
- `privacy-violations-summary.md` - Executive summary

---

## 🚦 Quality Gates Configuration

### **Violation Thresholds**

```yaml
variables:
  MAX_VIOLATIONS_THRESHOLD: "50"    # Maximum total violations
  FAIL_ON_HIGH_SEVERITY: "true"     # Block on high-severity issues
  PRIVACY_SCAN_TIMEOUT: "300"       # Scan timeout in seconds
```

### **Pipeline Behavior**

- **✅ Pass**: No violations or only low-severity
- **⚠️ Warning**: Medium-severity violations (allows merge)
- **❌ Fail**: High-severity violations (blocks merge)

---

## 🤖 AI-Enhanced Analysis

### **When Gemini is Available**

The pipeline automatically:
- Runs AI-powered privacy analysis
- Provides detailed explanations
- Suggests specific fixes
- Maps violations to regulations

### **Fallback Behavior**

If Gemini is unavailable:
- Hardcoded rules continue to run
- No loss of detection capabilities
- Pipeline continues successfully

---

## 📢 Notifications

### **Automated Alerts**

The integration sends notifications for:
- High-severity violations
- Compliance threshold breaches
- Pipeline failures
- Successful scans

### **Notification Channels**

- **GitLab Issues**: Automatic issue creation
- **Merge Request Comments**: Real-time feedback
- **Pipeline Status**: Visual indicators
- **Email/Slack**: Configurable webhooks

---

## 🔧 Customization

### **Environment-Specific Configuration**

```yaml
# Development
variables:
  MAX_VIOLATIONS_THRESHOLD: "100"
  FAIL_ON_HIGH_SEVERITY: "false"

# Production
variables:
  MAX_VIOLATIONS_THRESHOLD: "10"
  FAIL_ON_HIGH_SEVERITY: "true"
```

### **Custom Rules Integration**

Add your own privacy rules:

1. Create new rule in `src/ruleEngine/rules/`
2. Add corresponding tests
3. Update pipeline configuration
4. Deploy and test

---

## 📈 Metrics and Analytics

### **Key Performance Indicators**
