 * TypeScriptScanner - TypeScript File Discovery and Processing
 * 
 * The TypeScriptScanner is responsible for discovering and processing TypeScript (.ts) files
 * in codebases for privacy violation analysis. It implements the Scanner interface to provide
 * language-specific file scanning capabilities for TypeScript code.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Recursive directory scanning for .ts files
 * - Automatic path filtering for irrelevant directories
 * - UTF-8 content extraction for analysis
 * - Cross-platform path handling
 * - Memory-efficient file processing
 * 
 * File Discovery:
 * - Scans directories recursively for TypeScript files
 * - Filters out common irrelevant paths (node_modules, .git, etc.)
 * - Handles nested directory structures efficiently
 * - Supports large codebases with async processing
 * 
 * Content Processing:
 * - Reads file content as UTF-8 text
 * - Provides standardized ScannedFile interface
 * - Enables privacy rule analysis on TypeScript code
 * - Supports both client-side and server-side TypeScript
 * 
 * Privacy Analysis Support:
 * - Detects hardcoded PII in TypeScript code
 * - Identifies privacy policy violations
 * - Validates consent mechanisms
 * - Checks encryption and security practices
 * - Analyzes data flow and handling patterns
 * - Leverages TypeScript type information for enhanced analysis
 * 
 * Integration:
 * - Used by RuleEngine for TypeScript privacy scanning
 * - Works with all privacy rule types
 * - Supports AI-enhanced analysis via Gemini
 * - Enables comprehensive TypeScript codebase analysis
 * 
 * Performance:
 * - Async file system operations
 * - Efficient path filtering
 * - Memory-conscious file handling
 * - Scalable for large TypeScript projects
